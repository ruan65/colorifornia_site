### 40 shades of pink

Novadays almost every Android device has a power camera. 
Colorifornia takes this advantage and gives to users opportunity to pick a color from any picture or photograph.

Just take a shot and open it in the app. And you can also open any other picture from the gallery of your device.

There is possible to expand, shrink or move the photo, therefore the user can extract a color from any thin detail of the image.
The "aim" will show a point of the color that has been chosen.
