### 40 shades of blue

Novadays almost every Android device has a power camera. 
Colorifornia takes this advantage and gives to users opportunity to pick a color from any picture or photograph.

Just take a shot and open it, or any other picture from your gadget's gallery in the app.
There is possible to expand, shrink or move the photo, therefore the user can extract a color from any pixel of the image.
The "aim" will show a point of the color that has been chosen.
