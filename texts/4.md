### Create and save

The user can save any created color. There is "Favorites" mode where you can:

- Share parameters of all saved colors (or few of them)
- Open color on full screen (just click on it)
- Delete redundant colors
- Look through all favorite colors swiping them to the left/right

It's possible to select all colors at once for sharing or deleting.
